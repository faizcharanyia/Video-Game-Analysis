Rahul Sankar, Nicholas Ghimire, and I (Faiz Charanyia), were assigned a project for our Data Visualization Course at UT Austin. As a group of devoted gamers with a shared passion for the growth of the industry, we decided on a project to dissect and understand the dynamics of video game sales, genre popularity, console sales, and rating averages across different platforms. Our fascination with gamingâ€™s growth and its technological advancements drove us to explore these aspects deeply. This project aimed to collate and analyze data from various sources, offering insights into the trends that have shaped the gaming landscape over the years. We were finally able to leverage these insights to predict future trends associated with gaming.
